# Magic Quote Generator
Created a magic quote generator app using React, Hooks, and Fetch API. 
  The app fetches random quotes from an open API and displays them on the screen. 
  Users can sign in to save and view their own quotes, which are stored in local storage.
  Implemented user authentication and personalized quote browsing experience
